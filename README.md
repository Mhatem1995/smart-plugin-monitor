# Smart Plugin Monitor

**Advanced WordPress Plugin Intelligence, Diagnostics, Security, Performance, and Trust Platform.**

Smart Plugin Monitor is a professional-grade diagnostics and intelligence platform designed for WordPress administrators and developers. It provides deep visibility into your WordPress ecosystem, offering real-time monitoring, security auditing, and performance profiling to ensure your site remains fast, secure, and stable.

## 🛑 The Problem

Managing a modern WordPress ecosystem is inherently complex. Site owners and developers frequently struggle with:

*   **Slow Plugins:** Identifying which specific plugin is degrading page load times or consuming excessive server resources.
*   **Hidden PHP Errors:** Unseen warnings and fatal errors that silently break functionality or create vulnerabilities.
*   **Security Risks:** Unmaintained, abandoned, or vulnerable plugins exposing the site to potential exploits.
*   **Trust Issues:** Uncertainty regarding a plugin's origin, development standards, and code quality.
*   **Update Degradation:** Performance regressions and unexpected conflicts introduced immediately after plugin updates.

## ✨ Core Features

### Real-Time Monitoring Engine
Actively tracks resource consumption, database queries, and execution times for every active plugin. Identifies performance bottlenecks as they happen, preventing systemic slowdowns.

### Performance Diagnostics
Deep-dive profiling for individual plugins. Analyzes memory footprint and script execution to provide actionable intelligence on resource utilization.

### Security Scanner
Proactively audits installed plugins against known vulnerability databases and flags high-risk code patterns. Ensures your plugin stack adheres to strict security standards.

### Trust Verification
Evaluates plugins based on developer reputation, update frequency, repository standing, and code integrity. Establishes a trust score to help you make informed decisions about your technology stack.

### Historical Analytics
Maintains a robust ledger of plugin performance and security metrics over time. Visualizes trends to help you understand the long-term impact of specific plugins and updates.

### Action Layer (Scan / Safe Mode / Reporting)
Provides immediate remediation tools. Execute targeted scans, isolate problematic plugins using Safe Mode, and generate comprehensive diagnostics reports for stakeholders or development teams.
